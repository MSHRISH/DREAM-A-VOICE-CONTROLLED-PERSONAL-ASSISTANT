Speech Recognition: - The main feature of our PA is to the ability to be controlled by voice. The python module “speech_recognition” could
be used to capturing audio command from the user. The Recognizer in the module can convert speech to text. The commands given by the user 
is interpreted by python in form of text. Then the command is processed to give a output. 


pyttsx3:- This is a python text-to-speech synthesizer. This module is important because our PA should be able to speak with the user 
directly. 


TKinter: - Off course we need our PA to be inside an easy to use interface. This module is used to create GUI (Graphical User Interface)
applications. We don’t want our application to run in a terminal. 


Web browser: - With this module we can surf through internet using the keyword got from the user. It can search and display results in 
chrome.


Wolfram alpha: -Wolfram alpha is a computational knowledge engine or answer engine developed by Wolfram Alpha LLC, a subsidiary of 
Wolfram Research. It is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced
"curated data", rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine might. It
is used in PA to calculate math problems, equations and functions given by the user. It returns the answer in form of audio.
For example: - if we ask “what is sin 90?”, it will return answer as “1” in voice format.



Open CV: - This module is used to capture pictures and record videos from web camera.


Time module:- This module is used to get local time from user’s computer.


SMTP Module:- This module is used to send mails.


Other modules used: - OS module (for saving photos and videos captured in folder), random module (for giving random messages)
