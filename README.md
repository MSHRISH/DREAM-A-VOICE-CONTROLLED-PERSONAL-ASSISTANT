# DREAM-A-VOICE-CONTROLLED-PERSONAL-ASSISTANT

Human computer communication has growing demand recent days. As the world is moving towards computing utopia, people are being more consensuses towards the virtual world. There are numerous methods to communicate with computer. But most of them require a physical interaction with the keyboard and mouse. Speech is one the best way to convey any information. We can give speech as input to the computer. We could do this with the help of microphone. The input is in form of audio, if we could process the audio received from the user we can extract what the user is trying to say. Then we are going to need a processor to process the information, which we got from the user, to give desired output. 

WHY PYTHON?

Python seems to be more promising to do these tasks. It gives accessibility to vast number of libraries which could do help us in creating a voice controlled personal assistant. It has modules for converting speech to text as well as for converting text to speech, which will be relayed by us for creating personal assistant (PA).  Then it has modules for performing some important tasks such as processing our inputs to get desired output.
